  </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Taaffeite (/ˈtɑːfaɪt/; BeMgAl4O8) is a mineral, 
    named after its discoverer Richard Taaffe (1898–1967) who found the first sample, 
    a cut and polished gem, in October 1945 in a jeweler's shop in 
    Dublin, Ireland.[3][4] As such, it is the only gemstone to have been initially identified from 
    a faceted stone. Most pieces of the gem, prior to Taaffe, had been misidentified as spinel. 
    For many years afterwards, it was known only in a few samples, 
    and it is still one of the rarest gemstone minerals in the world.
